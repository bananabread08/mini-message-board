## Features and Functionalities

A basic message saving app.

- Check all messages.
- Send a new message.
- Route to home or to send message route.

## Objectives and Outcomes

This is my first time to use a real backend (`NodeJS + Express`). Took a while to understand some server side concepts, and also tried to both learn `pug` and `ejs` as templating engines. I opted to use `ejs` on this one because it's more intuitive. The routing concepts are quite nice and easy to understand. It is indeed fun to play with some of the HTTP methods like `post` and `get`. Overall, I am quite taking a liking to the backend.

## Development

- `NodeJS`
- `Express` using `express-generator`
- `ejs` as templating engine
- `nodemon`
